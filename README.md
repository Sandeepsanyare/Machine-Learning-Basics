Machine Learning Basics
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various machine learning techniques applied to an insurance dataset.

Project Overview
The notebook explores the following:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset insurance.csv is loaded using pandas and includes columns such as age, sex, BMI, smoker status, region, and medical charges.
Basic data exploration, including shape, summary statistics, and visualizations, is performed.
Data Analysis:

Examination of relationships between features like age, BMI, smoker status, and the insurance charges.
Insightful visualizations to uncover trends and correlations in the dataset.
Model Building:

Various machine learning algorithms (like linear regression, decision trees, etc.) are used to predict medical charges based on the available features.
Evaluation metrics are used to assess model performance.
Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the "Insurance Charges" dataset, which contains the following fields:

age: Age of the primary beneficiary.
sex: Gender of the beneficiary.
bmi: Body mass index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
children: Number of children covered by the insurance.
smoker: Smoking status of the beneficiary.
region: Region in the United States where the beneficiary resides.
charges: Medical charges billed to the beneficiary.
Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following dependencies:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
